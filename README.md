My interpretation of idea of a cookie clicker, made in unity.

Currenty game has only basic features. It has:
- Ability to make and sell cookies
- Ability to hire a baker to automaticly generate cookies
- SFX and background music
- Disasters, which can create some troubles for player
- Stats and messages
- Also you can hold control, shift or alt key, while selling the cookies to sell 25, 10 or 5 cookies in one click
